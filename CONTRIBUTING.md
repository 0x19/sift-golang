## Filing issues

When [filing an issue], make sure to answer these five questions:

3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

For any questions reach me over nevio.vesic@gmail.com. You can as well [create issue] in case
you've discovered something bad. Please make sure to give as much info as possible while creating issue.
